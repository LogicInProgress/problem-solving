The Euclidean theorem states that:

> The GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its remainder when divided by the smaller number.

ðŸ”¹ This is because any common divisor of a and b also divides a % b.

ðŸ”¹ The process reduces the problem size exponentially, making it super fast.
